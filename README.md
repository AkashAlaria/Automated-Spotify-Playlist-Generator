# Automated-Spotify-Playlist-Generator

To make use of this spotify package, you need to create an app at the developer.spotify.com website. For this, follow these steps:

Browse to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications.

Log in with your Spotify account.

Click on ‘Create an app’.

Pick an ‘App name’ and ‘App description’ of your choice and mark the checkboxes.

After creation, you see your ‘Client Id’ and you can click on ‘Show client secret` to unhide your ’Client secret’.

Use your ‘Client id’ and ‘Client secret’ to retrieve a token from the Spotify API. The function get_spotify_api_token() performs all necessary steps with your ‘Client id’ and ‘Client secret’ to retrieve a token. 

Run the file using streamlit run your_script.py

Add playlist according to your choices!!
